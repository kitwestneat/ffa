<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It may be safe to
speculate that women have always constituted approximately fifty percent of the
world’s population, and that they have lived through the same historical eras
as their male counterparts, however, when researchers investigate primary
source documents from any era, the overwhelming majority of these documents
record the actions and observations of men.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Only in recent memory has an effort been made to obtain and
preserve the writings and other historic observations that have been made by,
and about, women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The comparative quantity
of primary source material, written by women, concerning women’s lives and
contributions to history, remain small.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Historians are also quick to point out that the sources that are
available are usually from the upper crust of society; from literate women with
the time and resources available to write down their thoughts in letters and
journals; and/or women who achieved notoriety through their wealth or careers
and whose thoughts were deemed important enough to record for posterity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is rare, therefore, to have a
written set of historical observations made by a woman who is not wealthy or
well educated, about her own life; the life of her mother; and the lifestyle of
rural 19<sup>th</sup> century America where she lived.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann <span class=SpellE>Colgrove</span>
French was born in Tioga Co., Pennsylvania, a county in the north-central part
of the state, on the border with New York.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She lived for eighty-three years, from 1845 to 1928, in
Tioga County and, in her later years, a few miles south, in Lycoming County.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she was losing her sight, in the
1920’s, she was encouraged to write an autobiographical sketch of her life,
possibly by her grandson, Lyle <span class=SpellE>Doane</span>, who often
submitted articles to the local newspapers, and who had had a true interest in
preserving family history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann
French wrote in vivid, and sometimes minute, detail a description of her
childhood as she grew up on her father’s farm, in pre-Civil War Pennsylvania.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Transcribing her thoughts in a
free-flowing style, Ann French wrote her story on brown butcher paper that she
ironed flat and cut into rough letter-size.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Adding commentary about events and issues as she recalled them,
Ann French illuminates her memories with subjective perceptions of her era, and
makes comparisons with her life in old age.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>By also providing some information about her parent’s lives,
she takes the researcher back an additional generation to a period shortly
after the founding of the United States, as Americans were pioneering westward
into new territories of the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This paper will
use excerpts from the autobiographical sketch of Ann <span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span>
French as the basis for looking at the lifestyle of a young girl in a rural
family and how it might contrast with young women in town/urban areas; the
national and local events that influenced Ann French’s life; and how her
opinions and attitudes may have been shaped by her ancestors and handed on to
her descendants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Unfortunately, this
writer is not in possession of the original manuscript written by Ann French,
however, a photocopy of a portion of the work, consisting of the first part of
the sketch concerning the early stage of her life, was recovered from the
papers of Lyle <span class=SpellE>Doane</span>, after his death.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether Lyle <span class=SpellE>Doane</span>
made a photocopy of the entire biography which he may have acquired, or made a
copy of a portion because that was all he had, can’t be known for certain but
the latter reason seems more likely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As with many other primary source documents, this one is incomplete, and
preserved only as a certifiable duplicate of an originally hand-written work,
the value of which may not have been obvious to subsequent owners.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a dilemma regularly faced by
many researchers into the lives of women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Joan Burstyn, in an article from the History of Education Quarterly
titled, “History as Image: Changing the Lens” makes the observation, “Because
our forebears, both men and women, did not think women’s life experiences were
as important as men’s, and because they gave more importance to preserving
public than private documents, the records of many women’s lives have been
destroyed.” (p 16)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Speaking of source
documents concerning the women of the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>
century, Nancy <span class=SpellE>Woloch</span>, in the introduction to the first
part of her companion text, “Early American Women: A Documentary History
1600-1900” says, “it is tempting to rely on the output of the literary elite.” (p
1) For the vast majority of hard-working common women, who raised children and
kept a home, whether in a farmhouse or a tenement flat, there are very few
records of their perceptions of the era in which they lived.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Woloch</span> tells
us that the writings of men and information from the press are valuable sources
because, “To obtain information about ordinary women’s lives, historians have
had to delve into a far broader range of data than women alone were able to
provide.” (p 1)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She cautions,
however, “Such documents, while offering far more than the experience of the
literary elite, do not necessarily present a complete or accurate picture…of
women’s lives.” (p 2)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although <span
class=SpellE>Woloch</span> was referring to women of America’s colonial era,
her observations about the challenges that historians face when researching
ordinary women could be true of any period of history.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When good source documents are found
that give a female perspective to historical events it is important to
incorporate them into any discussion to offer counterpoint to observations made
almost exclusively by, and about, men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Joyce Appleby, et al., in their book, “Telling the Truth About History”,
tell us, “Historical research on women’s lives revealed differences which threw
into sharp relief just how gender-specific was the male ideal that had dominated
Western letters since the Greeks.” (p 153)<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the autobiography of Ann French there are insights into
the mundane aspects of a woman’s life that include descriptions of flowers and
trees, and especially the contents of the household, which would likely be
absent from any memoir written by a man of her era.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>By telling the story of her early life as a young girl on a rural
farm, and recounting some information about her pioneering parents, she is
giving us a glimpse into a world view often missed by male writers of history.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
first half of the nineteenth century, in the northeastern United States, was a
period that experienced rapid immigration from Europe (especially Ireland),
expansion of manufacturing and the building of textile mills throughout New
England, and the westward movement of people out of the over-populated coastal
cities and into the undeveloped forests and valleys of the northeast.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the Susquehanna River provided
a main route into the Pennsylvania heartland from Philadelphia, other pioneers
followed the Mohawk Valley across New York and then south by way of many
smaller rivers (and branches of the Susquehanna) into the northern tier of
Pennsylvania.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Following the
demarcation of the border between New York and Pennsylvania, in 1786-87, the
first European settler came to Tioga Co., Pennsylvania in 1787.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Further settlement came in groups from
various regions as discussed in, &quot;The History of Tioga Co.
Pennsylvania&quot; published in 1883, by W. W. <span class=SpellE>Munsell</span>
&amp; Co., &quot;They came from New York, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and the central and
eastern portion of the old Keystone State&#8212;from Lycoming, Northumberland,
Dauphin, Cumberland, Lancaster, Chester and Philadelphia counties.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This volume tells us that the county
seat of Wellsboro was established in Delmar Township, which was originally
named <span class=SpellE>Virdelmar</span> for the inhabitants who came from
Virginia, Delaware, and Maryland.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Many of the earliest settlers had been soldiers in the Revolution who
had fought with General Sullivan in his purge of the Iroquois tribes, during
the summer of 1779, or who had heard of the rich land from other soldiers and
woodsmen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann <span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span>
French begins her autobiography by explaining the route that her parents took
to arrive in Tioga Co., </p>

Co., N.Y. in 1814 where my parents were married April 1827.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They resided <span style='mso-tab-count:

Pennsylvania stopping in the Township of <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Farmington

class=SpellE>Buchers</span> Island (now Nelson) then they moved to Middlebury
Township locating on <span class=SpellE>Locy</span> <span style='mso-tab-count:

lived until Jan 15<sup>th</sup> 1876 <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>when

two sons + five daughters, one daughter Susie, dying at the age of 4 months in <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Feb. 1840</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>According to various sources on the
<span class=SpellE>RootsWeb</span> internet genealogy site, the <span
class=SpellE>Colegrove</span> family emigrated from England (or Wales) at some
time in the mid-17<sup>th</sup> century and lived for several generations in
Rhode Island.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann <span
class=SpellE>Colgrove</span> French's grandfather, William <span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span>,
to whom she refers in this passage, may have left Rhode Island because he was
the fourth son in a large family which would have been a common reason for a
young man to search out new horizons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span>Ann French says that her
parents settled on a &quot;farm&quot;, in Middlebury Township, but later
describes the conditions of that first home which must have required some hard
labor to be able to begin farming, &quot;When they moved to this place there
was only clearing large enough that the trees might not fall on their house +
the house then was a flat roofed shanty which served them for a home for over a
year&quot;, but things quickly improved for the couple, &quot;they built them,
what was considered quite a commodious, log house, the logs being 18 x 28 ft.
it faced south, with a large stone chimney in the west end a pantry in the
north west corner + stairway in the southwest corner, there we opened a door
find a fine stout ladder which we could easily climb to the chamber, where
there was one bed.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Up
in the loft were the bins that &quot;contained oats, wheat &amp; buckwheat,
&amp; several barrels of grain &amp; the flour barrel &amp; corn meal
barrel.&quot; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Also hanging from
the rafters to dry were kept many bags of dried berries and seed, as well as
medicinal herbs, &quot;such as mayweed, smartweed, boneset, lobelia,
peppermint, pennyroyal, hops, wormwood, <span class=SpellE>senna</span> &amp; a
bag of poppy flowers, slippery elm bark &amp; black cherry bark &amp; many
other things for the health of our family &amp; the neighbors.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Outside this log house was planted a
flower garden and hops, as well as current bushes and five cherry trees from
which they were willing to share, Ann notes, &quot;right here I must tell you
any of the neighbors that did not have these fruits could get them for the
picking at our place.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Inside
the main room of the house <span class=GramE>was</span> a family table, six
splint bottom chairs, two little chairs (for children), two spinning wheels
(&quot;the big one for wool the little one for flax&quot;) and &quot;Mothers <span
class=SpellE>wrocking</span> chair&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In contrast to the doorknobs and locks that Ann would live to see become
the norm in every home, the door to this house, &quot;had wooden hinges a
hickory latch with strings one to shut with &amp; one to open &amp; it was so
easy to fasten only to pull in the latch string.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The item of which Ann speaks most
proudly is the clock that the family owned, &quot;the logs were hewed down a
little space on the back of the room sufficient to give room for the Clock with
just shelf enough for it to stand on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My Mother paid for it which was $5.00 with woolen socks at 37&frac12; ¢
per pair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every home in those days
did not boast of a clock, a noon mark served very well.&quot;</p>

admiringly as a woman who, &quot;nearly clothed the family, that is she spun
the yarn colored it + always worked to pay for the weaving usually by knitting
socks and mittens to sell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Up to
this time they raised flax that Father got out + then Mother <span

one time set a broken arm for a small boy just to wait until the Doctor arrived

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span class=SpellE>Trinn</span> Fox
<span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span> lived with her mother and new step-father (to
whom Ann French refers as “Grandfather Hills”) for several years before getting
married, and took in laundry to help support her parents.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the first twenty-five years of her
marriage she cooked over an open fireplace, but Ann French tells us that new
technology is not always appreciated, “When I was 7 years old Father bought a
cook stove, ‘Clinton Air Tight’ drum stove it took Mother a long time to get
used to it + she thought it very unhealthy, as the fireplace kept up such a
fine ventilation without any cold drafts to either your head or feet as now.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cooking would be done on a stove, but
baking was still done in a separate oven, “About 20 ft from the west end of our
home was a large stone oven, which when filled with wood + burned down, then
raked out the coals + put in about 10 loaves of bread + then after that was
taken out the stones were hot enough to bake pies until nice and brown.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the work on the farm was done
in common with other women as a social event.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann mentions that her father kept fifteen to twenty-five
sheep and that, after her mother worked up the wool, “it was customary to have
a picking bee when 6 or 8 women were invited to help the same as to a quilting,
which were the social gatherings the same as are indulged in now by your
‘Society’ called Ladies with their crochet + <span class=SpellE>imbroidery</span>
etc., only then it was helping your neighbor + you did not work three days to
get ready to give them salad, wafers or ice cream, but they would have plenty
of meat, bread or biscuit or Johnny cake as the case might be mashed potatoes,
lettuce + onions + custard pie.”</p>

Protestant roots and, in keeping with their religious beliefs, they placed a
high value on literacy for all their children.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann <span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span> French, her brothers
and sisters, learned the basics of reading and math at home then continued
their formal education at local schools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Reading at home was focused on religious concerns which is illustrated
by the selection of material available in the house, “the library was small,
which consisted the large Family Bible, a few Historical Story books, The
Northern Christian Advocate + the Country paper beside the school books + the
M.E. Hymn books, but with this scanty supply we were taught how to live that we
might receive the blessings designed by God for his obedient children.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann tells us that the first church
services she remembers were held in a log schoolhouse where she also first
attended school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Going to school
would become easier when her father donated a piece of his land, “When I was
seven years old the frame School House on <span class=SpellE>Locey</span> Creek
was built, it stood on the corner of Fathers farm.”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann gives a description of her early education, giving a jab
at the craze for physical exercise that was prevalent in schools at the time
she was writing her memoir, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>“These school
terms were three months, in summer beginning first Monday in June, winter first
Monday of December.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Books were not
provided then, I had been taught the rudiments at home I read pretty <span
class=GramE>good</span> at seven years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My first Reader was called “<span class=SpellE>Cobbs</span> Juvenile
Reader”, that + my spelling Book were all the first term beside my writing Book
which Mother made of foolscap paper she also made the pen I used of a goose <span
class=SpellE>quil</span> + she was an expert at that job she also made the ink
we used with witch <span class=SpellE>hazle</span> bark + copperas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The next year I advanced + read in what
was called the “American Manuel<span class=GramE>”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I</span> read with the first class + the majority was from
two to 12 years older than me so I was quite proud of that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I also commenced studying
Geography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had been taught to
write numbers, enumerate, add, subtract, Multiply + Short Division at home.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The next winter I took an <span
class=SpellE>Arithmatic</span> “Davis”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We always read twice per day spelled twice wrote once, recited our <span
class=SpellE>Arithmatic</span> in fore noon.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Our Geography + <span class=SpellE>Grammer</span> in
Afternoon, worked examples anytime, not to interfere with our other studies for
we were not expected to study at home or rather required too, only did that as
we pleased only so our lessons were good, if not, they had to be repeated, at
this time, Spelling Schools were our Entertainment, pupils came from 4 other
districts + our people + pupils returned the visits, there was as much strife
in the spelling, as now in the Basket Ball games, + my opinion is that there
was much more good derived you see we got plenty of exercise in those days, so
no ‘gyms’ were needed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Self-sufficiency was learned early
on a farm in the rural hinterlands so it is not surprising that Ann also
mentions that she bought her first geography book with money she earned
knitting cotton socks, as well as her “Sanders” 4<sup>th</sup> Reader.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Religion
was as much an important social activity as it was a prerequisite of
faith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Piety was expected of
everyone on Sunday, &quot;None of us too small to kneel at this time at family
prayer + not one was expected to go anywhere on Sunday except to Church +
Sunday <span class=GramE>School</span>.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Sharing information with traveling preachers was a good way
to get news from other communities, and could be good entertainment, “My Father
+ Mother were Methodists of the original type but attended other denominational
services just the same + their home was always a stopping place for all,
Baptists, Christian + Presbyterian as well as the Methodist, where they partook
of such as they had with good cheer added to help them on their way.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann adds about the people attending
church services that, &quot;they did not go for show, but to praise the Lord +
Sun bonnets were more plenty then the Silk or <span class=SpellE>Legorn</span>
bonnet of those more fortunate that had them.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, in a disparaging remark concerning music in church,
she compares the old country church of her youth to the contemporary practices
of the 1920's when she extols, &quot;the vigor that was given to the singing of
“Come ye that love the Lord” or “When I can read my title clear” + “All hail
the power of ye”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thank God for
hearing the singing without noise of Organ which destroys the understanding the
words to them that are just listening.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The western New York border was only a few miles away, and
the Finger Lakes region was the home to the new Latter Day Saints of Joseph
Smith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann dismisses him in this
brief comment, “My Father went + heard him preach at a school house soon after
he had dug up his wonderful Book revealing Mormonism, he said he was not
ordinarily bright (was like Mary Baker Eddy).”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The central social and political issue of this era was the
slavery question which this family, of transplanted New Englanders, is likely
to have addressed on moral and religious grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann’s father was firm in his politics and had strong
feelings which he communicated to his family, “in politics Father was a “Whig”
+ voted that ticket when he was one of four in Middlebury Township, he also was
an Abolitionist in belief too + the belief for Liberty + freedom took deep root
in the minds of all us children + slavery was an abomination to us.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly this issue was discussed at
home, and probably at school, and in church often enough to take “deep root in
the minds” of the children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ann
<span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span> French’s grandparents all lived in New
England towns, and her father was twelve before he left Rhode Island.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In many respects, life in this part of
rural Pennsylvania resembled colonial village life, with trading posts where
goods could be bought and sold, and neighbors near enough to barter any surplus
that was grown or made on the self-sufficient farm.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Although there would be fewer people passing by the farm house
than in a village, there were enough social events associated with church and
school to bind families together into a community.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This strong sense of community, between the farmers and the
rapidly growing population centers in Tioga County, became increasingly
important as coal mining was developed as an economic resource.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a 1973 issue of Labor History, Irwin
Marcus discusses the coal miner’s struggles in an article titled, “Labor
Discontent in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, 1865-1905”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He tells us that, “By the 1850s a few coal companies
controlled most of the increasing coal mining operations in the area.” (p 415)
Tioga County had high-quality coal and access to nearby railroads that could
transport it cheaply to major markets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Labor unions were established by 1863 and “workers faced a long and
bitter strike in 1865.” (p 415)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Disruptions and animosity would continue through the nineteenth century,
in Tioga County, but the community would rally behind the miners, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>“The attitude and
behavior of the non-mining segments of the Tioga County citizenry…proved a key
factor in the eventual triumph of the miners.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Residents of <span class=SpellE>Blossburg</span>, the major
town in the area, contributed money, legal aid, and housing to the unemployed
miners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many local businessmen,
members of fraternal orders, and farmers also supported them.” (p 416)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The near-wilderness that Henry and <span
class=SpellE>Trinn</span> <span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span> had moved into,
in 1837, had become a rural farm community by the time Ann <span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span>
French was born in 1845.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ann was
married, at age 16, in 1861, and Tioga County was undergoing a shift in
economics and an increase of population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>By the time she died in 1928, the description that she gave of her young
life was of a time that had already passed into history, remembered by only a
few, and of a seemingly primitive lifestyle to most people living in the early
twentieth century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Off the main
road, Route 249 between <span class=SpellE>Keeneyville</span> and Little <span
class=GramE>Marsh,</span> is a road that winds up around the hills into an area
well known as French Hill. To the north is Farmington Township and to the west,
Chatham Township. French Hill was named for the French family. There was French
Hill School and French Hill Cemetery. In 1919 a series of stories was written
by one calling himself “old <span class=SpellE>Chathamer</span>.” This early
history is important because several persons are collecting data on this
pioneer family. French Hill was first settled by Moses French in 1833. In 1834
his brother, William, came. Both were sons of Jeremiah French, a Revolutionary
War soldier. This family moved from Northumberland County up the Susquehanna
River to Bradford County, and later settled on the Chemung River near Elmira,
where William French was born, June 3, 1790. Besides these two sons, there were
daughters. Needed is burial place of Jeremiah French, his wife’s name, and a
complete list of their children. These pioneers erected log houses, cleared the
land, and made homes for themselves that were quite comfortable. In addition to
farming, Moses French raised honey. He had two sons, Moses, Jr. and William. He
also had daughters. His farm was located just below the school house (see
Middlebury Township in the 1874 atlas). The farm in 1919 was owned by N.T.
(Nathan Towner) French. Near this farm was the one owned by William French. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>William French
married Esther Martin, a daughter of Gideon and Tanner Martin. They had three
sons, Nehemiah, William, Jr., and John W.; three daughters, Mariah, Louise and <span
class=SpellE>Lucretia</span>. William French was something of a genius. He was
a cooper, a carpenter, a farmer, a hunter, a <span class=SpellE>crackshot</span>,
and a great worker. When he needed cloth, he built a loom in which to weave it.
He built a spinning wheel, spun the yarn, and wove the cloth. When he needed a
barrel, a wash tub or a sap bucket, he made it. He also made a <span
class=SpellE>keeler</span> to wash dishes in and a <span class=SpellE>piggin</span>
for buckwheat batter. When he needed a threshing machine, he made that. He
always worked in the field all day without a hat and he never ate butter. He
never used a dog on his hunting trips; he simply took the track of a deer and
followed it. William French died in 1881 just a few days before his 91<sup>st</sup>
birthday. The school house on French Hill was built in 1859. The French Hill
Cemetery Association was incorporated 24 Sep. 1894 by A.D. <span class=SpellE>Shaff</span>,
S.J. Roe, N.T. French, P.D. <span class=SpellE>Shaff</span>, John Brown, and
James <span class=SpellE>Shaff</span>. It is located in the northwest part of
Middlebury Township. Many stones no longer exist. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Back to French
Hill: John Gideon Martin, an Irishman, came to America about 1765 and settled
in the New England states. He was a scout at the battle of <span class=SpellE>Oriskany</span>,
and was with Arnold and the 800 Massachusetts troops who drove the enemy back
to Lake Ontario. After that, he served as a scout with General Sullivan when he
swept the Seneca Lake country with sword and torch. John and his wife, Tanner,
came to French Hill with their son-in-law, William French. He lived there until
his death in 1845. There is no monument to mark his grave, but he is buried in
French Hill Cemetery. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>One of our
correspondents recently sent the following, taken from her great grandmother
French’s diary. Great grandmother French would be Ann <span class=SpellE>Roseltha</span>
<span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span>, who married John W. French, son of William
French and Hester Martin. (Written prior to 1928) Grandma French’s parents came
into Pennsylvania from Cortland County, New York, in 1837. Later they moved to
Middlebury Township and located on <span class=SpellE>Locy</span> Creek. As a
little girl Grandma French lived in a log cabin 18 x 28 feet long which her
parents had built. The family got up into the loft by using a ladder. They had
no stairs. There was but one bed; children slept on the floor. Among their
foodstuffs there were barrels of wheat, buckwheat, and oats, as well as flour
and cornmeal. The medical herbs and others akin to them were mayweed, <span
class=SpellE>senna</span>, smartweed, boneset, <span class=SpellE>lobella</span>,
peppermint, pennyroyal, hops, wormwood, poppy flowers, <span class=GramE>slippery</span>
elm bark. They also kept dried berries, flaxseed, and millet seed and onions.
On the main floor there was a pork barrel and a deep trough in which they kept
their Chinese asters, marigolds, <span class=SpellE>batchelor</span> buttons,
grass pinks, <span class=SpellE>mullen</span> pinks stars of Bethlehem. The
fruit trees were cherry, apple, and currant bushes. The oven for making bread
was about 20 feet from the west side of the cabin, large enough for ten loaves

her ancestors were natives of Conn. her mothers maiden name was Sarah Brooks

married April 1827.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They resided
there until Feb. 1837 when they moved to Pennsylvania <span class=SpellE>stoping</span>
in the Township of Farmington one year on a farm about one mile below Elbridge
on the road leading to <span class=SpellE>Buchers</span> Island (now Nelson)

they moved to this place there was only clearing large enough that the trees
might not fall on their house + the house then was a flat roofed shanty which
served them for a home for over a year, when they built them, what was
considered quite a commodious, log house, the logs being 18 x 28 ft. it faced
south, with a large stone chimney in the west end a pantry in the north west
corner + stairway in the southwest corner, there we opened a door find a fine
stout ladder which we could easily climb to the chamber, where there was one
bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the east gable, was a
window hole, which closed with a sliding board, in one side was bins which
contained oats, wheat + buckwheat, + several barrels of grain + the flour
barrel + corn meal barrel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Close
to the landing from the ladder was the Pork barrel + a deep trough which
contained the soap, also a barrel of salt.<span style="mso-spacerun:

pumpkin, flax, millet seed + onions + row upon row of herbs such as mayweed,
smartweed, boneset, lobelia, peppermint, pennyroyal, hops, wormwood, <span
class=SpellE>senna</span> + a bag of poppy flowers, slippery elm bark + black
cherry bark + many other things for the health of our family + the neighbors,
in the northwest corner of the ground floor was a bed with long curtains from a
<span class=SpellE>teester</span> (<span class=SpellE>tuster</span>?) frame
above + foot-curtains of the same, beneath this bed was a trundle bed, where my
brother slept when pulled out, in the South East corner was my parents bed,
with <span class=SpellE>valincies</span> instead of long curtains + foot
curtains both white at the foot of this was a partition making a sort of a <span
class=SpellE>bedsink</span> + beneath this was another trundle-bed where two of
my sisters slept at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was 3 years old + I slept with my Father + Mother, this summer of 1848 was the
date my memory commences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
log-house home did not have shingles roof but slabs, it was over 7 ft between <span
class=SpellE>florrs</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the
East End grew a very tall + large sweetbrier interspersed + around the corner
were tall trees, Malice (they called it) they ranged from 5 to 10 ft with most
beautiful large green fluted leaves, morning glory strung clear up to the roof
under the eaves china asters (single) + marigolds, ragged sailors bachelor
buttons, grass pinks + <span class=SpellE>mullen</span> pinks, Holy thistles, +
Star of Bethlehem I think completed the flower garden plenty of hops grew on
the several poles <span class=SpellE>scarted</span> about.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was five large cherry trees, which
gave us an ample supply for preserves + drying, a row of current bushes in the
front of the garden against a log fence + right here I must tell you any of the
neighbors that did not have these fruits could get them for the picking at our
place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To go back a little that
you can see my home inside more clearly, the logs were hewed down a little
space on the back of the room sufficient to give room for the Clock with just
shelf enough for it to stand on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My Mother paid for it which was $5.00 with woolen socks at 37&frac12; ¢
per pair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Evry</span>
home in those days did not boast of a clock, a noon mark served very well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the left of the clock was the family
table + between that + the pantry was a very good pine sink with leader out
through the logs + the logs were beautiful.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Two on this side was birds eye maple which glistened when
washed, the bark was taken off in the inside, one window gave the light which
was on the left of door on the South side.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The door had wooden hinges a hickory latch with strings one
to shut with + one to open + it was so easy to fasten only to pull in the latch
string.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only other furniture
was 6 splint bottom chairs two little ones Ems and Hi’s + and Mothers <span
class=SpellE>wrocking</span> chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I might almost count the spinning wheels as furniture as they were
nearly always in evidence the big wheel for wool the little one for flax, also
Swifts + Reel + Mothers cards, these she carded wool on if she could not wait
for it to be taken to the Carding Mill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was always a cheery fire in the fireplace + a big one on cold
days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the library was small, which
consisted the large Family Bible, a few Historical Story books, The Northern
Christian Advocate + the Country paper beside the school books + the M.E. Hymn
books, but with this scanty supply we were taught how to live that we might
receive the blessings designed by God for his obedient children.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>None of us too small to kneel at this
time at family prayer + not one was expected to go anywhere on Sunday except to
Church + Sunday <span class=GramE>School</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The first Church Services I remember were in a Log
Schoolhouse there was a pine table on one side that answered well for the
preachers desk the seats were slabs, with the round side down + wooden legs put
in + the writing desks were of the same fastened to side of the house.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a large fireplace in one end,
which at the time I first remember being there it was filled with green maple
bushes + ferns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can almost smell
them now + how much more invigorating Perfume that any bottled from the market
these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I remember the
Preacher very well too, his name was <span class=SpellE>Montagne</span> a Free
Baptist + English, he said the Lord willing there would be preaching there
again in a fortnight, if there <span class=SpellE>were’nt</span> Hymn books
enough he was quite proficient in <span class=SpellE>lineing</span> it to them
(now I think the people were good singers or they could not remember the tune)
but they did not go for show, but to praise the Lord + Sun bonnets were more
plenty then the Silk or <span class=SpellE>Legorn</span> bonnet of those more
fortunate that had them + the vigor that was given to the singing of “Come ye
that love the Lord” or “When I can read my title clear” + “All hail the power
of ye”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thank God for hearing
the singing without noise of Organ which destroys the understanding the words
to them that are just listening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To go back a little My Father + Mother were Methodists of the original
type but attended other denominational services just the same + their home was
always a stopping place for all, Baptists, Christian + Presbyterian as well as
the Methodist, where they partook of such as they had with good cheer added to
help them on their way, in politics Father was a “Whig” + voted that ticket
when he was one of four in Middlebury Township, he also was an Abolitionist in
belief too + the belief for Liberty + freedom took deep root in the minds of
all us children + slavery was an abomination to us.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I must return to the story of my home + its surroundings
back in 1848.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About 20 ft from the
west end of our home was a large stone oven, which when filled with wood +
burned down, then raked out the coals + put in about 10 loaves of bread + then
after that was taken out the stones were hot enough to bake pies until nice and
brown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps 50 ft farther was
the stone milk house built into the ground, here all good things to eat were
kept Father had no barn yet but a flat-roofed stable + stacked his hay, one
thing to first impress my mind was when Father let my brother Amos + I go with
him in the field to pull flax + we pulled a little and started to the house
when we got to the bars I climbed over and Amos set on top of them a minute
fell off striking on a stone + breaking his arm that is the first time I
remember seeing the Doctor (Harvey Leach)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I know Father + Mother were ready to go on a visit to Tompkins Co., N.Y.
+ postponed a <span class=SpellE>rew</span> weeks + when they came home they
brought what looked to one like the largest apples I ever saw + at this writing
I only lack a few days of being 75 years old.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I attended school in the Log School house I have already
described, my first Teacher was Nancy Clark (after Mrs. Dan Churchill) we were
taught to be very quiet + civil especially when people were passing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At this time we had a lovely bunch of
Hollyhocks that grew along the log fence next to the road by the garden they
were deep red + perfectly double.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My oldest sister found a little wild apple tree growing in the woods
when she was hunting the cows, brought it home + Mother set it out between the
roots of a stump in the front yard where it grew to a very nice shaped tree +
bore an <span class=SpellE>immence</span> lot of very good size + flavored
apples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1849 Father built a
good sized log barn I well remember the day it was raised (or rolled up) +
standing around + watching the man shave the shingles for its roof.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another event to me was that winter
John Cassidy taught the school + all the children but me went to School.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Cassidy
was a poor boy, a fine teacher very jolly + I enjoyed his coming because he
would help me knit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He went west
settled in Wisconsin about the year 1870 he became Governor of the State +
served two terms, he was a native of Middlebury.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The next spring my sister <span class=SpellE>Em</span>
attended School at the old Union Academy, the following summer she taught
school in Farmington.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The “Gee”
School (now called Elbridge) the next winter she + my brother Hi both attended
the same School together with <span class=SpellE>Sim</span> Spaulding + Sister
Laura.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess the next event was
Aug. 28<sup>th</sup> 1850 when my Sister Mary Jane and Abram Day were married
it was a little home wedding, there must have been 25 or 30 present I think,
all of them but myself have long since gone home, I can remember my grand
parents, Mrs. Day <span class=SpellE>Abes</span> mother, three brothers two
with wives + children, <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> + <span class=SpellE>Mrs</span>
<span class=SpellE>Ormsby</span>, Rhoda Beard, Sarah <span class=SpellE>Ormsby</span>
+ brother Hi stood up with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When I was 7 years old Father bought a cook stove, “Clinton Air Tight”
drum stove it took Mother a long time to get used to it + she thought it very
unhealthy, as the fireplace kept up such a fine ventilation without any cold
drafts to either your head or feet as now.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The same year they tore down + removed the fire place
chimney it left room when ceiled large enough for a bed + with curtains was
quite <span class=SpellE>comly</span> at the same time we had a window put in
the east end of the house altogether was quite an improvement.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mother, I might say, nearly clothed the
family, that is she spun the yarn colored it + always worked to pay for the
weaving usually by knitting socks and mittens to sell.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Up to this time they raised flax that
Father got out + then Mother <span class=SpellE>hetcheled</span> it, spun the
flax on the little wheel + the (?) on the big wheel which made our table
cloths, towels, bags, straw ticks, + the men folks pants for summer, she did
not make sheeting after I could remember.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Father always kept a medium sized flock of sheep 15 to 25 + whenever
they felt they wanted mutton they did not seem to think any more to kill a
sheep then a chicken + always killed two or more a season.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The wool Mother worked up, it was
customary to have a picking bee when 6 or 8 women were invited to help the same
as to a quilting, which were the social gatherings the same as are indulged in
now by your “Society” called Ladies with their crochet + <span class=SpellE>imbroidery</span>
etc., only then it was helping your neighbor + you did not work three days to
get ready to give them salad, wafers or ice cream, but they would have plenty
of meat, bread or biscuit or Johnny cake as the case might be mashed potatoes,
lettuce + onions + custard pie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
Mother was an excellent nurse + did at one time set a broken arm for a small
boy just to wait until the Doctor arrived but when he came he found it so well
done, did not disturb it, she was cool headed + always ready in an emergency,
she never spoke loudly but we all understood the first time that when she said
yes, or no it was final + no teasing, or arguing was ever indulged in, she knew
what hard usage meant, when she was 8 years old her Father died her Mother let
her go to live with a newly married couple who she thought would be very kind
to her, but she had to work very hard + if she broke a dish, she was given a
whipping, she let an iron tea kettle fall + cracked it when they were gone
away, she used to tell us how she <span class=SpellE>knealt</span> down +
prayed God to let her die before they came home of course she received the
flogging when they arrived she was small of her age too, she was not allowed to
eat with them + often her meal was corn mush + butter milk when the family were
partaking of bread, meat vegetables, pie + dough nuts etc.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After spending a year or more there she
went to live with another family, that did not whip her + she ate with them but
she slept in the attic where Harnesses were kept + her bed was a kersey blanket
with half under her + the other half over her on the floor, by accident she
went to the Fathers of this mans to stay while they were away, she had washed
her own clothes to the first place, there was a colored woman lived there + her
son, she said she was never more happy slept with Aunt <span class=SpellE>Cloe</span>
+ she washed + ironed her clothes beautifully or seemed so to her, that year
the Slaves that were in New York State were set free + she + her son attended
the celebrating of their freedom on July 5<sup>th</sup> she never went back to
the sons continued with the old people two or three years, after that her
Mother let her go to live with a Methodist Ministers family, the woman was nice
+ kind but the Preacher was a Tyrant + ruled with an iron hand but here Mother
began to assert herself some for she found out that he was a terrible
hypocrite, while living here, he made her stay alone in the sugar bush + boil
sap all night at 12 years + the wolves howling + panthers screaming was her
company, she knew she must keep a bright fire for in that alone was her
safety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well that summer a school
teacher boarded there + Mother discovered the Preacher (Mr. James Baker)
frequenting her bedroom, before his wife got up + she told a neighbor girl so
it became known, it got to be Feb. 1818 before he learned that Mother had told
of it + he proceeded to get two three beach whips to flog her with he had run
them through the ashes + fire to toughen, while so doing, a Sleigh drove up +
he took the whips + ran out the back door + just then under the steps, well the
people who came were Mothers, Mother + Step Father she had married + they came
after Mother she went with them + missed the, or rather escaped the whipping.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She found her Step Father, Mr. Hills, a
kind man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Grandfather Hills had a
grand daughter that went away with Joe Smith + his following.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My Father went + heard him preach at a
school house soon after he had dug up his wonderful Book revealing Mormonism,
he said he was not ordinarily bright (was like Mary Baker Eddy).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think Mother was at home most of the
time until her Step Father died about five years later, then she worked out at
house work or spinning until she was married April 1<sup>st</sup> 1827.</p>

this time, Spelling Schools were our Entertainment, pupils came from 4 other
districts + our people + pupils returned the visits, there was as much strife

  FRENCH</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;One of the pioneer families of Middlebury Township, Tioga County,
  Pennsylvania, was that of William and Esther French and another one was that
  of Henry B. and Anna <span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span>.&nbsp; The youngest
  child of each family, John W. French and Ann R. <span class=SpellE>Colegrove</span>,
  were married in September 1861.&nbsp; The young couple began housekeeping on
  a little farm not far from <span class=SpellE>Keeneyville</span> and here on
  October 18, 1862, their first child John Elmer, was born.&nbsp; The father,
  however, had enlisted in the service of his country and the young mother
  returned with her little son to the home of her parents, where they remained
  until the close of the war, when broken in health and suffering from the
  effects of a gunshot wound the soldier returned.&nbsp; In 1868, he removed
  his family to a small farm which he had purchased in Chatham, and here they
  lived until Elmer was twelve years of age.&nbsp; For this little home he
  always cherished the fondest memories; to him it was and ideal spot and in
  letters and verse he often alluded to this “Happy Day Land” of his childhood</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
October 1885 he was married to Dora Wood, of <span class=SpellE>Keeneyville</span>,
and to them was born one son, George E.&nbsp; His education was received in the
public schools, one year at the Soldiers’ Orphan School and two terms at the
State Normal School at Mansfield.&nbsp; When nineteen years of age he began
teaching and for twelve years taught in the schools of Chatham and Middlebury;
then he removed to Costello, where he taught five years and was two years
principal of the Galeton High.&nbsp; Following this he was engaged by a large
manufacturing firm as its representative and for a number of years he travelled
through the Central and Western States from Ohio to Texas.&nbsp; In 1912 he
became ill while in the West and returned to his home in Westfield, where he
suffered a long illness, from the effects of which he never fully recovered. <br>
&nbsp;<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
1918 he came to Elmira to take a position in the offices of the <span
class=SpellE>Willys</span>-Morrow Co.&nbsp; Six years later he accepted the
position of bookkeeper for the Elmira Building Units Co., where he was employed
at the time of his death.&nbsp; He was a member of the Elmira Council U. C. T.
and of the Westfield F. and A. M.&nbsp; He united with the Methodist Church at
Little Marsh when nineteen years of age and took an active interest in
Christian work and for many years was leader of the choir.&nbsp; He also composed
both words and music of many hymns for church use. <br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After an illness of only three
weeks he passed on his rest on the morning of the <span class=SpellE>annivesary</span>
of the birth of Lincoln, the one for whom his heart was full of devotion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><br>
“<span class=SpellE>Tho</span> the voice of the singer <br>
Forever is still, <br>
His songs linger here <br>
<span class=GramE>Mid</span> memories dear <br>
From the lips of the zephyrs, <br>
The trees and the rill, <br>
I hear them again, <br>
I hear them again.” <br>
From “The Little Brown Apple.” <br>
By J.E.F </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><br>
&nbsp;To those who have known him best, his memory will remain as a priceless
benediction.&nbsp; A man of <span class=GramE>simple&nbsp; and</span> refined
tastes, he loved the smiling scenes of Nature, the comforts of home and the
inspirations of friendship. <br>
&nbsp;He was ever a <span class=GramE>student ,</span> and never missed an
opportunity to learn something worth learning, feeling he might some time have
need of just that bit of knowledge.&nbsp; Never content with merely memorizing
facts, he meditated on, weighed and analyzed them.&nbsp; He not only did
things, but he did them in the best way of which he was capable, originating ideas,
methods and facilities; working with a tireless energy which characterized him
in everything in which he took an interest.&nbsp; As a teacher, he was
pre-eminently successful; giving directions with clearness and accuracy, and
developing in the lives of his pupils high ideals that are <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>uinperishably</span></span><span class=GramE>&nbsp; associated</span>
with their recollections of him. <br>
&nbsp;He was a skilled mechanic, having learned the carpenter's trade, and
during his years of teaching when school was not in session he followed this
occupation.&nbsp; In this he was painstaking and accurate, fashioning his work
with his soul in his job as a &quot;workman that <span class=SpellE>needeth</span>
not be ashamed.&quot;&nbsp; He was an ardent lover of his country and wrote and
sang words that kindled patriotism in many hearts.&nbsp; When travelling he
always visited all places of historical interest and could describe them with
the vividness and charm if the real story teller. <br>
&nbsp;To his friends he was generous, constant and loyal, and many have felt
that human touch upon the heart strings that has cheered and helped them
through seasons of <span class=SpellE>darkeness</span> when the spoken words of
sympathy or a timely letter written has been to them &quot;like apples of gold
in the pictures of silver.&quot;&nbsp; And when in the pilgrimage of life he
sometimes came to a place where the road was blocked, he kept his faith and
courage and always found the way round. <br>
&nbsp;His literary ability was of no mean quality, short articles and poems
having appeared in various periodicals.&nbsp; <span class=GramE>the</span>
three following of his own bits of verse were read as part of the service on
the morning when he was borne to his place of rest back near the old home in
Pennsylvania he loved so well. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THAT LITTLE WHITE CHURCH <br>
&nbsp;No other church in all this land, <br>
&nbsp; To me is half so dear; <br>
&nbsp;No other friends that I have known, <br>
&nbsp; Can ever seem so near; <br>
&nbsp;For in the days of hope and love, <br>
&nbsp; How oft' I '<span class=SpellE>ve</span> lingered there; <br>
&nbsp;To join in fervent songs of praise, <br>
&nbsp; Or bow in silent prayer. </p>

<p>&nbsp;In childhood days <span class=SpellE>i</span> saw this church, <br>
<span class=GramE>&nbsp; Spring</span> from verdant sod; <br>
&nbsp;The pride of all who sought a place <br>
&nbsp; In which to worship God. <br>
&nbsp;I've heard the clanging of the bell' <br>
&nbsp; That swings beneath the spire, <br>
&nbsp;And here I've learned the Gospel Truth, <br>
&nbsp; And here I've trained the choir. </p>

<p>&nbsp;'<span class=SpellE>Tis</span> here my mother loves to come, <br>
<span class=GramE>&nbsp; Although</span> she cannot see, <br>
&nbsp;She hears the story once again, <br>
&nbsp; And lisps a prayer for me. <br>
&nbsp;While all deplore her bitter fate, <br>
<span class=GramE>&nbsp; And</span> hearts with pity&nbsp; swell. <br>
&nbsp;She murmurs not, but clings to Him, <br>
&nbsp; &quot;<span class=SpellE>Whodoeth</span> all things well.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;O!&nbsp; when my day of toll is o'er, <br>
&nbsp; And all my sorrows past, <br>
&nbsp;And I have laid me down to rest <br>
&nbsp; In peace and joy at last, <br>
&nbsp;May Heaven smile <span class=SpellE>unpon</span> this church, <br>
&nbsp; And may the angels keep <br>
&nbsp;Watch o'er this little flock and fold, <br>
&nbsp; While I shall sleep and sleep. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (John Elmer French)&nbsp; J. E. F. </p>

<p>THE COMMON MAN <br>
&nbsp;He wanted good food; and hastened to the field <br>
&nbsp;<span class=GramE>To</span> gather fruit; but found the withered vines <br>
&nbsp;Plucked from the earth; and all the golden yield <br>
&nbsp;Lay trampled in the dust.&nbsp; He saw signs; <br>
&nbsp;Footprints of Greed; deep dented in the sand' <br>
&nbsp; But did not understand. <br>
&nbsp;He wanted clothes; and turned to find the flocks <br>
&nbsp;That once did graze in pastures on the hill <br>
&nbsp;Had perished; and nearby guilty rocks <br>
&nbsp;Where bleached their silent bones, he saw there still <br>
&nbsp;Footprints of Greed; deep dented in the sand; <br>
<span class=GramE>&nbsp; But</span> did not understand. <br>
&nbsp;He wanted shelter; and where once the trees <br>
&nbsp;<span class=GramE>Sprang</span> majestic beauty from the fen, <br>
&nbsp;He found but withered leaves; upon the breeze <br>
&nbsp;Dark fog and odors rose.&nbsp; He saw again <br>
&nbsp;Footprints of Greed, deep dented in the sands; <br>
<span class=GramE>&nbsp; But</span> now he understands. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; J. E. F. </p>

<p>LIFE <br>
&nbsp;Life - <br>
&nbsp;&quot;<span class=SpellE>Tis</span> but a breath, <br>
<span class=GramE>&nbsp; A</span> morning breeze, <br>
&nbsp; A sighing wind <br>
&nbsp; Among the trees - <br>
&nbsp; Then all is calm. </p>

<p>&nbsp;Life - <br>
&nbsp;'<span class=SpellE>Tis</span> but a thread <br>
&nbsp;<span class=GramE>That</span> spans between <br>
&nbsp;The present and <br>
&nbsp;The great unseen - <br>
&nbsp;A slender cord </p>

<p>&nbsp;Life- <br>
&nbsp;'<span class=SpellE>Tis</span> but a mist, <br>
&nbsp;A summer shower, <br>
&nbsp;A bursting storm, <br>
&nbsp;A silent hour, <br>
&nbsp;Then sweet repose. <br>
&nbsp; J.E.F. </p>

<p>In looking through some papers in his room this little poem was discovered
which doubtless was written a short time before his death. </p>

<p>WHEN I SHALL FALL TO SLEEP </p>

<p>&quot;Twill not be long ere I shall fall to sleep. <br>
And friend I love beside my bier shall weep; <br>
<span class=GramE>But</span> my poor soul will not be there, <br>
To see their tears or hear their whispered prayer. </p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Whene'er</span> that day shall come, let me not fear <br>
To close my eyes, or long to linger here; <br>
But give me faith to say, &quot;God <span class=SpellE>knowest</span>
best.&quot; <br>
Then when I fall to sleep, I'll sweetly rest. </p>

<p>Upon my breast <span class=GramE>lay</span> but a withered leaf, <br>
A symbol of the end of life and grief; <br>
Weave me no floral wreath of roses red; <br>
A rose can bring no joy when I am dead. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; J. E. F. </p>
